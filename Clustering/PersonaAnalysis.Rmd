## Import the data
```{r}
setwd("~/Google Drive/2018Code/R/PersonaAnalysis/Clustering")
library(jsonlite)
dset <- fromJSON("data.js", simplifyVector = FALSE)

g<- c(1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1)
e<- c(1,2,1,2,1,1,1,2,2,1)
a<- c(1,2,1,2,1,1,1,2,2,1)
```


## Clean and reformat the data
Make sure that your data is not missing any values and thea tthe features are on similar scales.
```{r}
dset <- data.frame(g,e,a)
```

## Run the K-means algorithm
```{r}
# Step 1
# Randomly assign the number of clusters to 3 with 20 iterations

kmeans_dset <- kmeans(dset,3, nstart=20)

# Look at the results

kmeans_dset
summary(kmeans_dset)
kmeans_dset$cluster
table(kmeans_dset$cluster)
plot(a ~ e, data = dset, col = kmeans_dset$cluster)
```
## How many clusters should I have?
```{r}
# Step 2
# Find a better value for the number of clusters using a scree plot

#### Initialize total within sum of squares error
wss <- 0

# For 1 to 8 cluster centers - because we have 10 values
for (i in 1:8) {
  km.out <- kmeans(dset, centers = i, nstart=20)
  # Save total within sum of squares to wss variable
  wss[i] <- km.out$tot.withinss
}

# Plot total within sum of squares vs. number of clusters
plot(1:8, wss, type = "b", 
     xlab = "Number of Clusters", 
     ylab = "Within groups sum of squares")

# Set k equal to the number of clusters corresponding to the elbow location
k <- 3

```





## R Notebook instructions

*This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.  *

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.**
